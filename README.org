* Introduction to Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the
deployment and scaling of applications using containerization. It allows for the
creation and management of lightweight, portable containers that encapsulate an
application and its dependencies. This reference card provides a quick overview
of Docker's key features and commonly used commands.

* Example invocation

Here is an example of how to use Docker to run a container:

: docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/usr/local/src/your-app ferrarimarco/github-changelog-generator

This command executes the "github-changelog-generator" image inside a Docker
container. Let's break down the components of the command:

- ~docker run~: This instructs Docker to run a container.

- ~-it~: This option enables an interactive session with the container, allowing
  you to interact with its shell.

- ~--rm~: This flag automatically removes the container once it finishes running.

- ~-v "$(pwd)":/usr/local/src/your-app~: This option mounts the current working
  directory (~$(pwd)~) to the =/usr/local/src/your-app= directory inside the
  container. This allows the container to access and modify files in the current
  directory.

- ~ferrarimarco/github-changelog-generator~: This specifies the image to be used
  for the container. In this case, it uses the "github-changelog-generator"
  image from the Docker Hub repository maintained by the user "ferrarimarco."

Feel free to explore Docker's extensive documentation and experiment with
different commands and options to unleash the full potential of containerization
for your development workflows.
